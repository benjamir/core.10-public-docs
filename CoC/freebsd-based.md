# Personal Code of Conduct

This is a personal effort to work towards being welcoming and respectful in any community or personal communication. To that end, I have a few ground rules that I want myself to adhere to:

*   be friendly and patient,
*   be welcoming,
*   be considerate,
*   be respectful,
*   be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others,
*   when we disagree, try to understand why.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that I can't do. Rather, a guide to make it easier to communicate and
participate -- and not to regret later on.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces I'm taking part of.
This includes
online chat,
mailing lists, bug trackers,
events, and any other form of communication. It applies to all of my communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats, things I say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even clothing I wear.

If you believe I violate my personal code of conduct, I ask that you report it by emailing
conduct@benjaminrampe.de.

*   **Be friendly and patient.**
*   **Be welcoming.**
I strive to be a person that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds
and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and
economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion or lack
thereof, and mental and physical ability.
*   **Be considerate.**
My work will be used by other people, and I in turn will depend on the work
of others. Any decision I take will affect users and colleagues, and I
should take those consequences into account. I want to remember that I might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
*   **Be respectful.**
I will not agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
behavior and poor manners. I might experience some frustration now and
then, but I cannot allow that frustration to turn into personal attacks. It's
important to remember that people who feel uncomfortable or
threatened are not productive.
I should be respectful when dealing with others.
*   **Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others.**
I do not want to insult or put down others. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    *   Discriminatory jokes and language.
    *   Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    *   Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    *   Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    *   Unwelcome sexual attention.
    *   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
*   In general, if someone asks me to stop, I'll stop. Persisting in such behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment.
*   **When we disagree, try to understand why.**
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that I resolve disagreements and differing
views constructively. We're different. My strength and support comes from varied communities, people from a wide range of
backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being
unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're
wrong. I won't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get
us anywhere. Instead, I focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from
mistakes.
